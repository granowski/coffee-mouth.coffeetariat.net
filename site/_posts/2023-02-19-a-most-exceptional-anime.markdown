### What happened to all the Anime?

Today I was able to do myself some good and actually get my ass into the gym.
Reminds me of [Papa Swolio](https://papaswolio.com)...
When I go to the gym and not doing a weight lifting day, it is most effective
to use a iPad with the elliptical machine. It's no wonder why a lot of these
machines in gyms have built in screens running on Android.
Either way, I still use my own tablet and I've found it quite a good time to log
into [Crunchy Roll](https://www.crunchyroll.com) to watch some good ol' Anime.

When I was young, my mother used to take me to the video game rental store.
We had a block buster on the corner where a CVS is now. The strip mall that used to be there
was torn down in the last decade... amazing how no one's past will be remembered, am I right?
[Where a Block Buster once stood](https://goo.gl/maps/YNuZjzDiTiDoN9Xw8).

We also had a home grown video rental store a couple blocks from there as well.
This store had a little rack of Anime amongst the video games and old shelves of
VHS tapes. One day I started asking my mom to rent the Anime and video games.

Now I must admit, this was only the beginning of my derangement.
Back in my day... you could rent anime like [Ninja Scroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Scroll).
Note the point in there about:

    In 2012, Robbie Collin of The Telegraph ranked it three of five stars, explaining that "Its baroque sadism and sexism hasnâ€™t aged well, but it still packs a visceral kick."

My mother had no idea... but for the weak stomach folk in the world today,
don't bother with it. Heavy themes of gore and rape in it.

So anywy, back to the point. While churning off some calories and putting the body to work,
I picked up watching [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan).
This is by far an exceptional anime. It's one that even non-anime lovers SHOULD love.
You don't have to be a Cowboy Bebop fan to appreciate this work.

The depth is worth writing about, but I won't bother with it. Just know that, it holds
very deep philosophical questioning. Much like how today's Nier Automata holds a deep 
philosophical depressive dystopian thought. However, instead of being that, it is about
comradeship, the meaning of life, why you should live.

Now my comrade and I, having moved to Knoxville Tennessee awhile back, were looking
for a thing to do. (Granted I'm personally in no short supply of things to do...) we
found an event on the Bookface (Facebook) for an Anime convention.

It was by far... the most... DISAPPOINTING experience I've seen in awhile.
Not because of the millenials, but because of the lack of actual f'n Anime!
The millenials today are doing a great job with their cat maid trans outfits,
and yada yada of Kawaii manuerisms. They are only way too sensitive though, way too many
people being like "OMG, I HOPE you don't take this the wrong way! But... Watashi ni wa, anata wa kawaiku kanpeki desu!!! Itsu made mo aishimasu!!!"
and then them being like "OMG, DESU DESU" and of course with some more desu after that.

We watched around, enjoyed some cat girls, but I was let down by literally not a single
f'n Anime video was present for sale. There are artifacts of anime that people can not
see today. We should be bringing back the DVDs, and etc. I used to watch this one called
 [Ayane's High Kick](https://animanga.fandom.com/wiki/Ayane's_High_Kick).
But that one is not so much the concern. My concern is a variety of "other" ones.
There are ones that were produced and are not "legal" so to speak due to the plot of their story.
We must recall that there was a time, when people actually had stature and produced content
in opposition of their beliefs and interests for intellectual sake.
After all, not everything can be a Hentai!
Not everything needs an unnatural tentacle penetration porn...

So anyway... I suppose that's enough ranting, as I should be digging into this
framework. Work work work work work!

MAKE ANIME CON GREAT AGAIN. Bring back Anime shelves and get rid of those stupid
plastic "Nendroids". It's just plastic gonna end up in the ocean. A movie artifact is
actually something I can share with people...
