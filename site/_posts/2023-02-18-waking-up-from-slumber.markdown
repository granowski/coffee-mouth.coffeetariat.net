### Waking Up
It's been awhile since I'd practiced any of my personal software adventuring.
Almost everything I do is for work. Work work work work work!
Even this site is being generated using a ruby framework, [jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com/), a tool my current
employment is considering using for some documentation efforts.

An ex-coworker from my days at WOW also has been reaching out. With the lay-offs that
have occurred, it makes sense to think forward. To get out of the lull of lazy joy!
So here it is.

Onward!
